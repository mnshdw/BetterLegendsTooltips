**Better Legends Tooltips:**

This mod attempts to improve some tooltip issues commonly seen in Legends, and its sub-mobs such as Sellswords Updated (SSU) and Rise of the Usurper (RotU).

**What does it do?**

This mod shortens combat dialog, location and enemy party tooltips by merging multiple enemy champions of the same type into a single group.

It also has an option called "Merge Named Enemies" that you can toggle on or off if you prefer to keep unique champion names intact.
After all, "Despicable Dick" is more immersive than "Champion Sellsword Veteran" ;)

**Exact engagement numbers**

The mod honors the value of the "Exact engagement numbers" setting in Legends options:

- If the setting is enabled, the tooltip will display exact numbers (eg. "6 Champion Orc Warriors").
- If the setting is disabled, a qualifier will be used instead (eg. "Some Champion Orc Warriors").

**Examples**

Here are some examples with all 3 cases:

| Disabled                 |  Enabled with Merge Named Enemies | Enabled without Merge Named Enemies
