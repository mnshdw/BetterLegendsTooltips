**Better Legends Tooltips:**

This mod attempts to improve some tooltip issues commonly seen in Legends, and its sub-mobs such as Sellswords Updated (SSU) and Rise of the Usurper (RotU).

**What does it do?**

This mod shortens location and enemy party tooltips by merging multiple enemy champions of the same type into a single group.

If you prefer to keep unique champion names intact, the mod has an option called "Merge Named Enemies" that can be toggled on and off.
After all, "Despicable Dick" is more immersive than "Champion Sellsword Veteran: ;)

Here's an example with all 3 cases:

| Disabled                 |  Enabled with Merge Named Enemies | Enabled without Merge Named Enemies
